\begin{frame}{Research Methods}
  Research methods are the \textbf{procedures, schemes, and algorithms} used
  to conduct research. They include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Theoretical procedures}
    \item \textbf{Experimental studies}
    \item \textbf{Numerical schemes}
    \item \textbf{Statistical approaches}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Research Methodology}
  Research methodology is the \textbf{systematic approach} to solving problems.
  It provides a \textbf{structured plan} for conducting research.

  While research methods help us obtain solutions, research methodology focuses
  on understanding the \textbf{why and how} of the process. It involves:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Why was the research study undertaken?
    \item How was the research problem formulated?
    \item What types of data were collected?
    \item What methods were used for analysis?
    \item Why was a particular technique chosen?
  \end{enumerate}
