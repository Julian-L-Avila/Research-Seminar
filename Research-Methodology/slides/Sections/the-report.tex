\begin{frame}{Main Text}
  The main text documents the research process, findings, and conclusions.  
  It should include:  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Introduction:} Context, objectives, and significance  
    \item \textbf{Research Work:} Methodology, experiments, and results  
    \item \textbf{Summary and Conclusion:} Key findings and implications  
  \end{itemize}

  The final report may require multiple drafts to refine clarity and coherence.  
  It must be self-sufficient, providing all necessary details for reproducibility.
