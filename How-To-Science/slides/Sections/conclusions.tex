\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \textbf{Science is a dynamic process.}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The scientific method is not a rigid sequence but a
      network of interconnected processes.
    \item Theories evolve as new evidence emergesâ€”certainty in
      science is always provisional.
    \item Parsimony guides scientific progress by favouring
      explanations with fewer assumptions.
    \item Peer review is useful but not infallible; critical
      thinking remains essential.
    \item Applications of scientific knowledge drive technological
      and societal progress.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Science advances by continuously refining ideas through
  observation, testing, and feedback.}
